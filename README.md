# Github Analyser

Github Analyser was created as part of my study at the CODE University of Applied Sciences Berlin.
It is a REST-API, written in Golang that faciliates the GitHub GraphQL Api to get extensive stats about
GitHub users. Additionally it applies a statistical score metrics on the data to rank the users by for example
activity and popularity. This makes this data more compareable and understandable.
